During my internship, I worked on developing a Myntra clone website, focusing on the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I designed the site’s structure, including a navigation bar, search bar, and footer, while styling it to mimic Myntra’s clean and modern aesthetic. I integrated Material Icons for interactive elements like the profile, wishlist, and shopping bag. I also worked on adding product sections and a placeholder for item listings, although these were not yet functional. Additionally, I implemented basic JavaScript for interactivity, such as tracking items in the shopping bag, and used Git for version control. This project enhanced my web development skills, particularly in creating responsive and user-friendly e-commerce interfaces
